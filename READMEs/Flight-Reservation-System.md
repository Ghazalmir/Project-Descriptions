# Flight Reservation System 
The Flight Reservation System is a command-line program that models flights departing from the Pearson Airport during a single day. Initially done as the final project for a university course (CPS 209) and expanded over time, this program uses OOP, collections, file I/O and exceptions, objects and classes, inheritance, and interfaces in Java.
